# Ideas to enhance the solution

Dynamic Service Discovery:

Instead of hardcoding message types into the factory, use reflection or a DI container's capabilities to discover and instantiate the appropriate service based on naming conventions or attributes.
This avoids manual updates to the factory for each new queue service.
Strategy Pattern:

Introduce a strategy pattern to determine the queue's processing logic. This allows easy changes to the processing logic without affecting the reading/writing logic.
Queue Configuration Management:

Instead of solely relying on a config file, consider an admin dashboard or API for dynamic configuration management of queues, routing keys, exchanges, etc.
Middleware or Decorator Pattern:

Introduce a middleware or decorator pattern for pre- and post-message processing tasks. This could be for tasks like logging, validation, or transformation.
Event-Driven Architecture:

Instead of explicitly writing to specific queues, publish events. Subscribers can listen to these events and decide which queue to write to. This would further decouple the components.
Enhanced Error Handling:

Introduce a Circuit Breaker pattern for handling repetitive failures.
Implement a retry mechanism with exponential back-off for transient errors.
Performance Enhancements:

Introduce batching mechanisms to handle high-throughput scenarios.
Consider implementing a caching mechanism if required.
