i'm fine. how about yourself?
i'm pretty good. thanks for asking.
no problem. so how have you been?
i've been great. what about you?
i've been good. i'm in school right now.
what school do you go to?
i go to pcc.
do you like it there?
it's okay. it's a really big campus.
good luck with school.
thank you very much.
i'm doing well. how about you?
never better, thanks.
so how have you been lately?
i've actually been pretty good. you?
i'm actually in school right now.
which school do you attend?
i'm attending pcc right now.
are you enjoying it there?
it's not bad. there are a lot of people there.
good luck with that.
thanks.
i'm doing great. what about you?
i'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
everything's been good with you?
i haven't been better. how about yourself?
i started school recently.
where are you going to school?
i'm going to pcc.
how do you like it so far?
i like it so far. my classes are pretty good right now.
i wish you luck.
i know. i think it may rain.
it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
that would be weird.
yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
yes, it would be.
i really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
me too. i can't wait until winter.
i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
i'd rather be cold than hot.
me too.
you're right. i think it's going to rain later.
in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
that wouldn't seem right.
considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot.
i know, you're absolutely right.
i wish it would cool off one day.
that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon.
i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot.
that's exactly how i feel.
that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
any rain right now would be pointless.
that's right, it really would be.
i want it to cool down some.
i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter.
winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
i would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
yes, it is.
it looks like it may rain soon.
yes, and i hope that it does.
why is that?
i really love how rain clears the air.
me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.
yes, but i love the night air after it rains.
really? why is it?
because you can see the stars perfectly.
i really hope it rains today.
yeah, me too.
it really is.
it seems that it may rain today.
hopefully it will.
how come?
i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
i especially love the night air when it rains.
really? why?
the stars look so much closer after it rains.
i really want it to rain today.
yeah, so do i.
yes, i think so too.
i think that it's going to rain.
i hope that it does rain.
you like the rain?
the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it.
i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner.
i love most how it is at night after it rains.
how come?
you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
i would love for it to rain today.
that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
is it going to be perfect beach weather?
i believe so.
good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
i know. i really want to go to the beach.
but you know that california weather is really unpredictable.
you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?
the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
it sounds like it will be.
i really hope it doesn't get cold.
that would ruin things, i want to go so badly.
the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know.
that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
it would be nice if the weather would never change.
that would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
true. predictable weather would make life easier.
what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too.
the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
will it be good beach weather?
i think it will be.
it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm.
this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.
i know. every day the weather seems different.
i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
that would make it easier for us to make plans.
this is she. how's it going?
i've been trying to call you all day.
sorry about that. i was cleaning up.
it's okay.
so what were you calling me about?
oh, i just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.

that sounds like fun. let's do it.
i'll see you tomorrow then.

she's really pretty.
describe her to me.
she's not too tall.
well, how tall is she?

i believe so.
no. have you?
she's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
what does she look like?
well, she's quite short.
how tall would you say that she is?
i would say she's only five feet.
what about her facial features?
she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
i think i know who you're talking about.

i wasn't really feeling well.
what was wrong with you?

that's okay.
i hope you feel better.

yes, i do.
when did you learn how to do that?
i learned back in high school.
oh, so you took an art class?
yeah, i loved that class.
i see that you're pretty talented.
thank you very much.
i wish i had a talent like that.
i'm sure you have a talent. it's just hidden.
i've always liked to draw and paint.
i didn't know you knew how to draw and paint.
i do it every once in a while.
how long have you known how to do that?
i first learned how to do it in high school.
did you take some sort of art class or something?
that was my favorite class.
you have got to be talented.
thanks.
if only i was talented.
you have a talent. you just don't know what it is yet.
when i have time, i sometimes draw and paint.
oh, you actually do that?
every so often, i do.
did you always know how to draw and paint?
i was taught in high school how to draw and paint.
you had an art class?
exactly, it was my favorite class.
well, it's good that you're so talented.
i appreciate that.
talent is a great thing, i wish i had one.
my favorite movie is superbad.
oh, why is that?
it's the funniest movie that i've ever seen.
that's true. it is a very funny movie.
you've seen it before?
yes, i saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters.
didn't you laugh through the whole movie? i did.
me too. that movie brought tears to my eyes.
mine too.
i have it on dvd at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
sure, let's go.
i have to say, my favorite movie is superbad.
is that right? why?
honestly, it is one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time.
you're right. that movie is hilarious.
i didn't think you saw that movie.
i went to see it the day it came out.
i was laughing through the whole movie.
i couldn't help laughing, either.
same here.
i bought the movie. would you like to come to my house and watch it?
of course.
i'm going to have to say that superbad is the best movie ever.
you think so, how come?
well, superbad is super funny.
you're not lying, i found that movie absolutely hilarious.
i didn't know that you saw superbad before.
i made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.
i couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
i was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.
that's exactly how i felt.
i got the movie when it came out on dvd, do you want to come over?
i like listening to different kinds of music.
like what, for instance?
i enjoy rock and r&b.
why is that?
i like the different instruments that they use.
that's a good reason to like something.
yeah, i think so too.

so what was the score?
the score was 101-98.

i'm going to the movies with a friend. how about you?
i'm not sure yet.
well, did you want to go see a movie with me?
what movie are you going to see?
i'm not sure yet. is there something you want to see?
there's nothing i can think of.
so, did you want to go?
no, thanks, maybe another time.
okay, sounds good.
i am going to see a movie with a friend of mine. what about you?
i don't know.

don't mention it.
when you miss a day of school, i'll be happy to give you the english assignments.
what happened?
our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
she did? why didn't anyone tell me?
i would've thought that somebody would have told you.
no, i had no idea.
well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
oh my god, that's great!
are you going to go and visit her and the baby?
i think that i might.
good! i just thought i'd let you know.
thanks for telling me.
heard what?
debrah already had her baby.
i didn't know that.
i thought you knew.
i honestly didn't know.
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
that's good to hear.
will you go and visit them?
of course i will.
i just wanted to give you the good news.
thanks for letting me know.
i haven't heard anything.
debrah had her baby last week.
nobody told me.
i thought you heard.
i really wasn't told anything.
she was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
wow, how exciting.
i know, you should really go and see her and the baby.
of course i will.
i just wanted to let you know what happened.
of course. did you?
i didn't want to, so i didn't.
that's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?
that's a switch.
i'm serious, have you?
no, i haven't. why?
i really want to go to the movies this weekend.
so go then.
i really don't want to go by myself.
well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?
no, i think i'm going to go to the movies.
i always do. did you go to school today?
no, i didn't.
you should have, but have you seen any movies lately?
that was an odd change of subject.
maybe it was, but answer the question.
no, not recently.
i want to go to see a movie this weekend.
what's stopping you then?
i don't want to go alone.
so, will you be at school tomorrow?
no, i want to go to the movies instead.
yeah, i went. did you go?
no, i didn't feel like it.
that's nice, have you been to the movies lately?
no, but that was a random change of subject.
it may have been random, but have you?
i haven't lately.
i would love to catch a movie this weekend.
so then, why don't you just go?
i don't want to see a movie by myself.
okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?
it's no problem. i was really missing you anyway.
i missed you too.
why haven't you tried to come see me then?
i've been really busy.
doing what?
working.
i would've come to see you sooner, but i've been busy too.
what have you been doing?
i've been working too.
well regardless, i'm very happy that you came to see me.
i am too.
i had to. i was missing you a lot.
i was missing you too.
so, why haven't you visited me?
i've actually been busy lately.

basically, i've been working too.
well whatever, i'm glad you came.
so am i.
i really missed you a lot.
i've been missing you like crazy.
i don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
lately, i've been quite busy.
tell me what you've been up to.
i've really been working a lot lately.
i've been pretty busy myself.
so what have you been up to?
i've just been working a lot.
whatever the reason may be, i'm glad you visited me.
yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation.

what time does the party start?
it starts at 8 o'clock.

i know, it does sound pretty awesome.
well, when does the party start?
it's supposed to start at about eight.
how many invitations has she given out?

that's not nice.
i apologize, but i'm getting off the phone now.
okay.

yes, it is. but it still looks good.
do you take good care of it?
oh, yes. i wash it once a week.
do you change the oil?
my mechanic changes the oil twice a year.
no, i don't. do you?
i don't have a girlfriend, either.
why not?
i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough.
girls like guys with money.
they sure do.
they like guys with new cars.
i don't have money or a new car.
me, neither.
but girls like guys who are funny.
maybe we should learn some good jokes.
i have to walk the dog.
what kind of dog do you have?
i have a little poodle.
poodles bark a lot.
they sure do.
they bark at everything.
they never shut up.
why did you get a poodle?
it's my mom's dog.
so she likes poodles.
she says they're good watchdogs.
sure. why do you need it?
i want to buy lunch.
where's your money?
it's not in my wallet.
your wallet is empty?
i don't have even one dollar in it.
being broke is no fun.
even if it's only for a short while.
it's always good to have friends.
friends will lend you money when you're broke.
as long as you pay them back.
that's a great idea.
we haven't been in a while.
we haven't been in a month.
the last time we went, you almost drowned.
no, i didn't.
then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
i think he wanted to cool off.
he swam right up to you.
and then he turned right around.
maybe you're right.
maybe we should get going.
no. i'm divorced.
when did you get divorced?
i got divorced two years ago.
why did you get divorced?
my wife left me.
why did she leave you?
she said she didn't love me anymore.
wow! that's terrible.
yes, it was.
why didn't she love you anymore?
she fell in love with my best friend.
what's on tv?
nothing.
there must be something on tv!
nothing that's interesting.
what about that new game show?
which one?
"deal or no deal"
tell me you're joking.
i love that show.
i watched it once. that was enough.
it's on right now. let's watch it together.
i agree. pasadena is a nice city.
it's not too big.
and it's not too small.
it has great weather all year long.
it has the rose parade.
it has beautiful houses.
it has wonderful restaurants.
it has great schools.
it's close to the mountains.
the people are friendly.
i'm not ever going to leave.
what's the matter with this one?
it's not comfortable.
it seems fine to me.
i toss and turn all night.
you should stop drinking coffee.
look at these marks on my arms.
what are they?
they are bites.
did the cat bite you?
no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
okay. let's get a new mattress.
buy a new one.
i would if i had the money.
why is it so slow?
that's a good question.
did you take it to a computer shop?
i would if i had the money.
well, i guess you have to live with it.
sometimes i want to throw it out the window.
you don't want to do that.
why not?
you might hit someone in the head.
i'm not sure.
how about a pizza?
you had pizza for lunch.
but i love pizza.
everybody loves pizza.
so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
because you need variety.
what's "variety?
different thingsnot the same thing all the time.
you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
no, i mean a salad instead of a pizza.
why do we need to save money?
because we need to buy a house.
but a house is so expensive.
that's why we need to save money.
how much do we need to save?
we need to save enough for a down payment.
how much is that?
that's about $30,000.
thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
not if we save every penny.
okay. here's seven pennies.
you can't see the end of it.
it goes on and on forever.
and it's deep, too.
i think it's five miles deep.
are there fish at the bottom?
there are fish at the top and the bottom.
are there more fish or more people?
i think there are more fish.
i hope so. i love to eat fish.
why is that?
i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me.
what happened?
i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself.
that was very nice of you.
i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
why did she do that?
he said he would buy her a nice ring.
what's wrong with that?
he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.
i hope your mom broke up with him.
of course they talk to each other.
what do they talk about?
they talk about other animals.
what else do they talk about?
they talk about food and the weather.
do they talk about us?
of course they talk about us.
what do they say about us?
they say that we are funny-looking.
ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
we're funny-looking because we wear clothes.
yes, it's very dirty.
you can help me.
why me?
because you helped make it dirty.
what do you want me to do?
i want you to clean the bathroom.
oh, that's easy.
clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
that's a lot of work.
tell me when you finish.
i don't think so. you'll just give me more work.
what do you mean?
i mean you're wasting your life.
i'm having fun.
you're sitting there with your mouth open.
who cares?
i care. do something.
okay. i did something.
what did you do?
i turned up the volume.
that's not what i meant by "do something."
will you do something? leave me alone.
yes, i did.
did you tell her about school?
i told her that school is fun.
did you put the letter in an envelope?
yes, and i sealed the envelope.
did you put a stamp on the envelope?
i couldn't find any stamps.
they're in the kitchen drawer.
okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.
give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you.
when is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
i'm sleepy.
why don't you go to bed?
i want to watch this tv show.
maybe you should record it.
the tape recorder is broken.
then you should watch the rerun.
why? i'm watching the original.
but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
okay. i'll tell you how the show ends.
zzz.
so?
you know what that means.
i forgot.
sunday means we go to church.
oh, yeah.
put on a coat and tie.
why?
to show respect to god and others.
i'm glad sunday is only once a week.
i hope god didn't hear that.
he'll forgive me.
i'll do that in a minute.
the cat is meowing. he's hungry.
okay. i'll feed him right now.
you shouldn't make him wait.
i was doing my homework.
the cat doesn't care about your homework.
the cat doesn't care about anything.
that's the way cats are.
all they think about is themselves.
maybe we should get rid of him.
of course not! he's family.
me too.
i just cut myself again.
did you use a new blade?
it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut.
maybe you should use an electric shaver.
they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
maybe you should stop shaving.
and grow a beard?
sure. why not?
because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
hmm. here's an idea. put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
yes?
are you reading this paper?
oh, no. help yourself.
i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
some people would just pick it up.
yes, i know. some people are rude.
i always try to be polite.
so do i.
the world needs more polite people like us.
i agree 100 percent.
let me think about it.
why do you have to think about it?
because a puppy costs money.
no, it doesn't. puppies are free.
yes, but a puppy needs shots.
shots for what?
so it won't get sick. just like you get shots.
i hate shots.
and a puppy eats food. food costs money.
no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.
oh, no you don't. puppies don't eat vegetables.
how many are there?
eight.
they're all so cute.
yes, but i can't keep them.
what are you going to do with them?
i'm going to give them away. do you want one?
yes, i would love one.
which one do you want?
that one. the one that's all black.
yes, i like that one, too.
i'll call him blacky.
they trust in god.
they hope they will go to heaven.
they probably will.
but no one knows for sure.
that's for sure.
no one knows what happens after we die.
if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god.
that's what many people believe.
if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
i don't want to go to hell.
let's go to church with your parents on sunday.
i'm sorry for you.
thank you.
when did he die?
a couple of months ago.
you still miss him.
yes, but i talk to him almost every day.
when you go to church?
no, when i call him on his cell phone.
what do you mean?
i buried him with his cell phone.
what will you do when the battery dies?
that's a bad day.
it's supposed to be unlucky.
you're supposed to stay home all day.
that's what i do.
my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth.
that was a mistake.
he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
what happened?
someone stole his laptop.
he was asking for it.
he learned his lesson. he's home today.
of course.
prove it.
how can i prove it?
take me to dinner.
that's it? that's all i have to do?
take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's.
but a nice restaurant costs money.
yes, and you have to make a reservation.
that's such a hassle.
i knew you didn't love me.
okay, okay! i'll make a reservation right now.
so are mine.
why did your parents get divorced?
my father found a new girlfriend.
that's too bad.
my mother was hurt and angry.
she had good reason. what did she do?
she told him to drop his girlfriend.
what did your father do?
he moved out of our house.
i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
yes, but she left him a year later.
so does mine.
i think it's an old people's smell.
really?
yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell.
like fruit that is too ripe?
yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
but the smell is different.
yes, old people don't smell like fruit.
no, they smell like a thrift shop.
yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
yes, an old smell.
i think stamps used to cost a penny.
that was a long time ago.
it was before i was born.
now a stamp is 42 cents.
but in may it will be 44 cents.
have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
no, i haven't.
neither have i.
so, they do a good job for the money.
yes, they do.
maybe we shouldn't complain.
what are you going to do?
first, i have to find the button.
where did you lose it?
i have no idea.
a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?
that's a good idea.
i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
let me look. no, it's not there.
many shirts come with an extra button.
you're right. this one does have an extra button.
now all you have to do is sew it on.
you drink too much coffee.
but i love coffee.
well, it's your life.
you eat too much chocolate.
i don't think so.
have you looked in the mirror?
do you think i'm getting fat?
i didn't say that.
what did you say?
i said i have to go to the bathroom.
that's what i thought you said.
yes, i did.
what did you wash?
i washed the sheets and towels.
what about the pillowcases?
yes, i took them off the pillows and washed them.
did you dry everything in the dryer?
yes, i dried everything in the dryer.
then what did you do?
i folded all the towels.
did you put the sheets on the beds?
yes, and i put the pillowcases on the pillows.
i listen day and night.
what do you listen to?
mostly talk radio.
what's that?
people talk about current events.
what do they say?
they say they want change.
what kind of change?
they want tax cuts.
why do they want tax cuts?
because tax cuts will save them money.
look in the fridge.
i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
are you sure?
it's almost empty.
i went to the market yesterday.
i don't see anything.
i bought lots of oranges and apples.
i don't want fruit. i want something tasty.
eat the fruit. it's good for you.
next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
no, thank you. all you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.
i don't know. look in the fridge.
i think i'll make a sandwich.
what kind?
a ham sandwich.
the bread is in the cabinet.
where's the mustard?
it's in the fridge, i think.
oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?
yes, that sounds nice.
how about some potato chips?
yes. and a pickle, if we have any.
but, mom, i'm not dirty.
you need a bath every day.
why?
because you don't want to smell bad.
i don't smell bad.
that's what you think.
if i smelled bad, i could smell me.
i can smell you.
i can smell you, too.
that's my perfume.
when can i wear perfume?
exactly what?
all i get is a black screen.
what's the matter?
i think i know, because this happened before.
what happened before?
my hard drive crashed.
oh, no. that's bad news.
it sure is, but i'm going to call hp first, just to make sure.
will you lose all your files?
no, i always back up my files.
you're smart.
what did they say?
they said i need a new hard drive.
that's too bad. how much is a new one?
it's not too much, only about $85.
plus installation?
no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
really?
yes, it's just a couple of screws.
that's nice.
it's a lot better than paying someone $60.
if my hard drive crashes, i'll just call you.
it's bluedog123.
bluedog123. are you sure that's all?
yes.
no. that's incomplete.
what do you mean?
what's your mailing address?
456 cherry drive, pasadena, ca 91170.
that's correct.
so what's the problem?
bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and zip code.
oh, i get it. my email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com.
you should unplug the phone.
that's a good idea.
do you want me to wake you in an hour?
no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up.
i'll start dinner at 6:00.
okay. i think i'll be awake by then.
if not, your nose will wake you up.
you mean i will smell the food cooking?
you might even dream about dinner.
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
have a nice nap.
yes, dad, it was.
the son gave a nice speech about his father.
it was long, too.
i think it was about 45 minutes long.
but it went by fast. it was interesting.
i liked it.
i'll give you a speech like that, too.
do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
of course.
i think only the family will be there.
you have lots of friends. they will be there, too!
i had to blow my nose.
did you have to blow right next to the phone?
did you hear that?
of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
it wasn't that loud.
i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
okay. i'll take your word for it.
i thought you had an elephant in your house.
you're funny.
what did you say? i think i've gone deaf.
i'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. i'll be right back.
really? how many do you have?
i don't know, maybe one hundred.
that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend?
of course. i have lots of best friends.
how many best friends do you have?
i think about twenty-five.
hmm. i have only one best friend.
i feel sorry for you.
i have only a few friends.
you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you.
that's very nice of you.
why would i do that?
because men like to cheat.
some men do, but not me.
i'm watching you.
i'm an open book. watch me all you want.
if i catch you, you'll be sorry.
you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater.
i will poke your eyes out.
i don't want any other woman.
i will chop your toes off, one by one.
honey, please. you're the only woman for me, forever. i swear it.
me too.
why do you hate to go outside?
i meet too many jerks.
i agree.
this city is full of jerks.
rude people are everywhere.
but what can you do?
you can yell at them.
and they will yell back at you.
yelling doesn't do any good.
no. the best thing to do is just stay home.
are you having problems with it?
i don't understand some things.
let me help you.
what does "mi" mean?
"mi" stands for middle initial.
what does "mm/dd/yy" mean?
that means month/day/year. use numbers.
i don't understand.
for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.
oh. that's simple enough.
always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.
what do you want to do?
i want to get a puppy for my son.
that will make him so happy.
i'll get him one of those little dogs.
one that won't grow up too big.
and eat too much.
do you know which one he would like?
oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked.
i bet you had to drag him away.
he wanted to take it home yesterday.
i wonder what he'll name it.
i don't know. i just woke up.
why don't you look outside?
okay. it looks like rain.
why do you say that?
the sky is gray.
is it raining right now?
no.
how do you know?
the street isn't wet.
i have to go shopping today.
you'd better take an umbrella.
it's not even noon yet.
that means it will get hotter.
i am dying from the heat.
turn on the air conditioner.
it doesn't work.
what happened?
i don't know.
did you call the repairman?
of course.
when is he coming?
he's busy. he said next week.
why is that?
because i love the snow.
yes, the snow is fun.
last year we made a big snowman.
how big was it?
it was seven feet tall.
how long did it take?
it took us all day.
did you give him a nose?
of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.
let me help you make one this year.
what do you need to do?
i need to withdraw some money.
how are you going to do that?
i'll just use the atm.
what's that?
it's the automatic teller machine.
it gives you money?
i just insert my debit card into the machine.
and it gives you money?
well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.
oh. what good is that? i thought it gave you free money.
oh, no. i forgot.
well, you'd better take it out front.
what time does the recycle truck come by?
it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow.
i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
oh, no, you don't.
what do you mean?
every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
do you think i'll forget to do it?
you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
okay, i'll take it out front right now.
ready for what?
ready for the big switch.
what are you talking about?
the nation is switching to digital tv.
oh. of course i'm ready.
did you buy the converter?
no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv.
how much was that?
it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
does it pick up any digital channels?
oh, yes. i get six korean channels but nothing in english!
they sure are.
did you hear about the pilot?
the one that stole a small plane?
yes, he stole a plane in canada and flew into the u.s.
did they catch him?
yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
did he crash?
no, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?
his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
poor guy.
how do you know?
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.
do they know what the robber looks like?
yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
what race is he?
they didn't say.
the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
of course not. that would be racist.
but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
don't ask me.
then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
but i don't have a tissue.
then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
i didn't have time to get one from there.
your sleeves are not tissues.
but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
that doesn't make it right.
i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
i will talk to your father about that.
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
your daddy was a good little boy.
how do you know? were you his mommy, too?
worried about what?
i'm getting married.
you should be happy, not worried.
i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
yes, you have to take care of your wife.
and i have to take care of our children.
are you going to start a family?
yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
that sounds wonderful.
except we can't afford it!
no wonder you're worried.
or artists.
they're in a different world.
i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
artists see things differently.
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
of course! he's world famous.
did he ever take art lessons?
i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
where are they? maybe they are worth millions.
the point of what?
of living.
who knows? you live, and then you die.
we must be here for some reason.
maybe we're here to have fun.
then why aren't i having fun?
because you're thinking too much.
so i should stop thinking?
stop thinking about what the point is.
okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
just be patient. fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
so are cigarettes.
which would you prefer?
what do you mean?
when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
i could pick only one or the other?
yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
boy, that's a tough one.
what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes.
but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
well, you can't have everything.
i don't think i want to go to your heaven.
you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
criminals, of course.
anyway, i have to fix the hole.
you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
tell me about this patch.
the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
that sounds a lot easier than sewing.
it is. but after about ten washings, the glue washes off.
i can't remember jokes.
neither can i.
they go in one ear and out the other.
who makes up all these jokes?
who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
yes, just in english alone.
i wonder if every language has jokes.
of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
what do you think people joke about the most?
i think most jokes are about women.
oh, really? i think most jokes are about men!
why do you say that?
you speak two languages.
well, my english isn't perfect.
no one speaks perfect english.
maybe i will be the first!
i've been thinking about learning spanish.
spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
how long will it take me to learn?
i think it will only take you a year or two.
how soon can we begin?
ahora! that means right now.
yes, it's april 22.
it's more than just a date.
is it your birthday or anniversary?
no, it's earth day.
what's that?
it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
how about if i take shorter showers?
that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
i don't know anyone who likes it.
some of it is okay, i guess.
yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
like "one, two, buckle my shoe."
but people still write poems.
no one makes any money at it.
shakespeare was a poet.
did he get rich from his poetry?
probably not.
poems are a little bit like songs.
yes, but songs have music. without music, songs would suck, too.
i don't know. i think i'm average.
did you ever take an iq test?
no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.
i wish i was really smart.
don't be ridiculous.
what do you mean?
if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
it must be very lonely.
why's that?
because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.
nothing that would pass as news.
what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels.
what was the lead story on the news?
some actress was in court for driving without a license.
what was the second story?
some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
what was the third story?
a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
wasn't there anything about octo-mom?
of course. she's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
well, mostly i'll try to avoid it.
i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
my wife and i will be cremated.
are you going to be buried next to each other?
oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
you're not going to be buried?
a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
we figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
yes, of course i wiped my feet.
then why is there mud on the carpet?
i don't know. it's not my mud.
well, someone brought it into the house.
look at the bottom of my shoesthey're clean.
of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.
okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner.
don't vacuum it now.
don't you want me to clean up the mud?
wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum.
next time i will be more careful.
what are you talking about?
sunday is mother's day.
this sunday?
of course. it's all over the news.
i thought it was next sunday.
well, you'd better get her something.
i'll get her a nice card.
is that it?
yes. that's all i ever give her.
she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
it's okay. she knows that i love her.
what's the matter with it?
it's too much like other flags.
yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
a flag should be pretty.
what should our flag look like?
it should have a pretty woman on it.
that's ridiculous!
you don't like pretty women?
of course i do. but not on our flag!
every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
you can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
what did you do?
i watered all the plants.
you have a lot of plants.
then i did my laundry.
that takes some time.
i took the dog for a walk.
i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
i vacuumed the entire house.
that's a lot of work.
and then i made lunch.
i'll bet you were hungry!
so how do you make long distance calls?
i use a calling card.
where do you get that?
i buy it at the dollar store.
how much is it?
it's one dollar for 100 minutes.
that's only a penny a minute!
it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.
how many?
first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
yikes. i think i'll keep my long distance service.
yes, i do.
what college do you go to?
i go to pasadena city college.
do you like it?
