# Data

Usually, raw data can't be directly used to train a model because some adjustments are required like: removing dirty values, formatting...When this process is completed then the "processed" data are ready to be provided to the model.

This folder contains both "raw data" and "processed data", while "process.py" script ([here](../scripts/preprocess.py)) actually executes the real computation.
